    "1. GPS-tracker: GPS data is recorded on *21* cargo bike routes in various areas in the city of Groningen. The routes are located in the GPS folder within this project. \n",
    "2. Manually recorded data at the depot: ontains general information on *569* cargo bike routes. Every route data point contains the date, postal code area, type of cargo bike used (and if electrically assisted), number of parcels (categorized as small/medium/large), volume of parcels and weather conditions.\n",
